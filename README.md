# USCF MSA Visual Fix

This Chrome extension addresses a visual alignment issue on the United States Chess Federation's (USCF) Member Services Area (MSA) pages. Also, it integrates a feature to check and display SafeSport certification status for tournament directors by fetching and verifying data from the SafeSport certification page instead of making tournament directors verify themselves.

## Features

- **Visual Alignment Fix**: Corrects table layouts and image spacing on USCF MSA pages for a cleaner, more consistent display.
- **SafeSport Certification Check**: Automatically retrieves and displays the SafeSport certification expiration date for tournament directors directly on the MSA page.

## How to Use

1. **Install the Extension**:
   - Open Google Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
   - Click "Load unpacked" and select the folder containing the extension files

2. **Access USCF MSA Pages**:
   - Visit any USCF MSA member detail page, using `https://www.uschess.org/msa/MbrDtlTnmtDir.php?{USCF_ID}`.
   - The extension will automatically apply visual fixes and check for SafeSport certification.
